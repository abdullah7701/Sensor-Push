## 🌟 Project Overview

SensorSync Dashboard is a modern web application that displays real-time sensor data in a visually appealing, interactive table. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, it offers features like search, temperature history popups, and notification toggles, making it ideal for monitoring sensor metrics efficiently.

## ✨ Unique Feature: Gradient Glow

The dashboard stands out with its **Gradient Glow** design—a subtle, dynamic gradient background that transitions from soft blue to indigo, creating a futuristic and engaging UI. Coupled with status tags (green for Online, red for Offline) and smooth hover effects, it delivers a delightful user experience.
